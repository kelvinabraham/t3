    <p>RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE</p>
    <p>1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</p>
    <p>
      2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players
      take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or
      diagonally) is the winner.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks
      in a row, the game ends in a tie.

    <p>HOW CAN I WIN AT TIC-TAC-TOE?</p>
    <p>
      To beat the computer (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little
      bit of strategy. Strategy means figuring out what you need to do to win.
      Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three Xs in a
      row. The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the computer from
      getting three Os in a row. After you put an X in a square, you start
      looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X? You look at the
      empty squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let
      you make three Xs in a row. You also have to watch where the computer puts
      its O. That could change what you do next. If the computer gets two Os in
      a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row,
      or the computer will win. You are forced to play in a particular square or
      lose the game. If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never
      lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win, but at least you'll tie.
